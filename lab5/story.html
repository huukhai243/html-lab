                        <h2>Our Story</h2>
                        <p>
                            What is the one philosophy that drives SCAAL? We believe that no matter where you go, you
                            should
                            always be able to enjoy
                            the simple pleasure of a good cup of coffee in a comfortable environment. At home, reading
                            the
                            morning paper. At your
                            local SCAAL, conversing with a confidant. Or perhaps in some foreign land, SCAAL will be
                            greeting you like an old
                            friend. After all, coffee is a ritual that transcends all cultural boundaries. It makes us
                            feel
                            alert, energetic and
                            alive.

                        <h2>
                            Where we began
                        </h2>
                        <p>Anders Carlson lived a sheltered life in a small fishing village in Marstrand, Sweden. As a
                            child, he listened to
                            stories of his grandfather Oluf’s adventures and expeditions. Often his grandfather would
                            bring
                            back exotic coffees for
                            the family to enjoy.

                            Upon his graduation Anders left home to see the world. He worked all kinds of odd jobs. He
                            worked in Parisian cafes and
                            Italian espresso bars. He worked in the coffee fields of Brazil and New Guinea. And in a few
                            years, Anders learned the
                            art of selecting the perfect coffee bean and roasting it to perfection.

                            He returned home in 1980 to open the first SCAAL in Stockholm, Sweden. By creating his own
                            unique blends of coffee and a
                            stimulating atmosphere, SCAAL quickly became the place to gather – day or night – not only
                            in
                            Stockholm, Sweden, but 670
                            cities around the world.</p>



                        <h2>
                            What makes SCAAL the best coffee?
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Anders has passed down the knowledge he learned as an apprentice in the coffee fields to
                            every
                            buyer, roaster, and
                            franchise owner. SCAAL's standards for coffee are never compromised. We only select SHB –
                            strictly hard bean or strictly
                            high grown – coffee beans. To ensure their flavorful oils are preserved, extraordinary steps
                            are
                            taken to protect the
                            coffee bean from heat, light, air and moisture.

                            All these efforts are made so that we may offer you a perfect cup of coffee.

                            There are so many places you could go to buy coffee. We've gone to extraordinary efforts to
                            ensure that SCAAL is your
                            best choice. The quality begins at harvest. SCAAL relies on selective picking, a
                            labor-intensive
                            process that involves
                            making several passes among the trees for those cherries that are perfectly ripe. Then we
                            select
                            top grade SHB, which
                            stands for strictly hard bean or strictly high grown. Beans that are grown at a minimum
                            altitude
                            of 4,000 feet above sea
                            level for optimum flavor. Within hours of shipping our coffee to you, the beans are roasted
                            on-site in small batches by
                            a Certified Roastmaster and vacuum-packed to retain its fresh taste and rich aroma.
